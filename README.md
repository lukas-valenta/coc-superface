## Install

Download the `.vsix` file from one of the Github [releases](https://github.com/superfaceai/language-client-vscode/releases).

Install the extension using

```shell
code --install-extension <path-to-vsix>
```

## Usage

The extension automatically starts a bundled language server and provides syntax highlighting grammar definitions for vscode.

## Development

When developing, start with cloning the repository using `git clone https://github.com/superfaceai/language-client-vscode.git` (or `git clone git@github.com:superfaceai/language-client-vscode.git` if you have repository access).

After cloning, the dependencies must be downloaded using `yarn install` or `npm install`.

Now the repository is ready for code changes.

To test your changes there is a launch task prepared in the `.vscode` folder. Open the Run tab in your vscode and select the task "Launch Client". Then click the "Start Debugging" button or F5 and a new vscode window should open up with the WIP extension active.

The `package.json` also contains scripts (runnable by calling `yarn <script-name>` or `npm run <script-name>`):
- `lint` - lint the code (use `lint:fix` to run autofix)
- `format` - check the code formatting (use `format:fix` to autoformat)
- `build` - run the typescript compiler
- `prepush` - run `test`, `lint` and `format` checks. This should run without errors before you push anything to git.
- `package` - package the built output into a vsix extension

To install the extension from a local build, execute the `build` script, then the `package` script and then [install](#install) the generated vsix artifact.

## Publishing

Package publishing is done through GitHub release functionality.

[Draft a new release](https://github.com/superfaceai/language-client-vscode/releases/new) to publish a new version of the package.

Use semver for the version tag. It must be in format of `v<major>.<minor>.<patch>`.

The publish CI workflow will build and package the extension and upload it as a release asset. It will be available in the [releases](https://github.com/superfaceai/language-client-vscode/releases) section.
